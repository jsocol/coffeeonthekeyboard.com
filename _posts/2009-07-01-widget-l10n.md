I spent some of today working on bringing a couple of WordPress widgets up-to-date ([Better Search][1] and [Most Comments][2]) only to discover there is a [new widget API][3]. I guess I haven&#8217;t been paying attention.

I&#8217;ll probably start some 2.0 branches tomorrow to take advantage of the new API. I wish I didn&#8217;t know how many people don&#8217;t keep their WordPress installations up to date, so I wouldn&#8217;t care about backwards compatibility.

At least both widgets got nice new, and functional, internationalization (i18n) code and new localization (l10n) files.

And BSW got a good feature update, incorporating some suggestions from [Marco Jung][4], who is also, kindly, doing a German localization, and a few of my own. The built-in search widget has stepped up it&#8217;s game, and fixed the thing BSW was originally designed to fix (no widget title) so I have a higher bar to clear to justify the name &#8220;*Better* Search Widget.&#8221;

I&#8217;ll write up the new features tomorrow.
