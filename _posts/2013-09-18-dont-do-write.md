Setting up a new server? Adding a new user? Installing a new package? Running a new service?

Don&#8217;t *do* it, *write* it.

It doesn&#8217;t really matter how or where you write it. Write a new [Fabric][1] task, update a [playbook][2], update a [Puppet][3] module, or write a new one. Whatever you have to automate tasks, even if it&#8217;s a shell script.

Then run it.

Then the next time you have to do it, run it again.
