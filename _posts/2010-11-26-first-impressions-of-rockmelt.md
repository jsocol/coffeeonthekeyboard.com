I finally got around to installing the [RockMelt][1] beta, and have had it open for a day or so now, sort of using it in parallel with [Firefox 4][2]. This is a very early impression, and not terribly organized. Once I&#8217;ve used it more I&#8217;ll try to be a little more comprehensive.

*I&#8217;m honestly not trying to come off as a Firefox 4 sycophant, but as it&#8217;s the browser I use for all my non-work browsing, it&#8217;s my natural comparison. All opinions are my own and in no way represent Mozilla.*

**As a browser**

RockMelt is still just a browser at its core. It&#8217;s based on [Chromium][3], and it keeps a lot of stuff going in parallel. Firefox with 14 tabs is using about 450MB of RAM right now, plus around 21MB for Flash, in two processes. RockMelt, with 4 tabs, has 11 processes using 260MB. I know it&#8217;s maintaining connections to Twitter and Facebook, but apparently not very efficiently.

It&#8217;s Chromium; it&#8217;s WebKit; it&#8217;s fine. There&#8217;s nothing to complain about in the rendering or modernism departments. The OmniBar still doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to the AwesomeBar. It adds a Firefox-style dedicated search field, which is strange with the OmniBar focuses so heavily on search results. (Both fields include social results from the attached services, I really don&#8217;t know what the search field is for.)

It imported my bookmarks from Firefox automatically, which is thoughtful, but it really lacks the UI to do much with them. I&#8217;ve seen work from Mozilla&#8217;s UX team that tells me bookmarks can be better: I&#8217;m still waiting for someone to do it.

RockMelt feels like a step backwards from Firefox 4 for day-to-day browsing. I miss the AwesomeBar, App Tabs, and Panorama most. It&#8217;s probably a completely horizontal move from Chrome, though.

**As a social tool**

Obviously the reason to use RockMelt isn&#8217;t it&#8217;s spectacular browsing experience, it&#8217;s the *social* browsing experience. Unfortunately, &#8220;social&#8221; means &#8220;Facebook and Twitter.&#8221;

RockMelt builds in two very popular services but it really falls short with any others. The left side of the browser shows all my Facebook chat contactsâ€”which would be great if I used Facebook chat. The right includes widgets that let me stay up to date with Facebook and Twitter by opening in-app (which I can pull to outside the app) lightweight clients.

There&#8217;s an &#8220;experimental&#8221; Gmail Notifier which works well-enough. There are two Facebook widgets, one for notifications and one for my News Feed. I can add a widget for any RSS/Atom feed, which doesn&#8217;t do much for me personally but I could certainly see having value.

The most active social tool is a &#8220;Share&#8221; button next to the OmniBar, that let&#8217;s me post a link to Twitter or Facebook. [F1][4] adds the same thing to Firefox and includes Gmail, though, admittedly the UI in RockMelt is better (smaller, faster, feels more native).

I understand why Twitter and Facebook were first, but I wouldn&#8217;t have shipped a beta without at least some Gmail and/or Google Talk integration. If I could replace the Facebook Chat border with Google Talk it would be a lot more valuable to me. Social results in the OmniBar should include my Google contacts.

**As a Twitter client**

The built-in Twitter client disappoints me. It updates too rarely and lacks features I&#8217;ve come to expect in a Twitter client, most notably a way to view conversations (it&#8217;s only supported on the timeline tab, not the mentions tab where it would be more valuable). It tries to be helpful by including images and videos inline but I honestly find that more annoying than I think they intended, and I can&#8217;t find a way to turn it off.

Viewing replies is either two clicks, or I have to leave open a column that takes maybe 20-25% of the width of the client for nothing but the tabs. A horizontal tab strip would have used a lot less space.

That leaves me leaving Twitter open in a pinned tab, which I can already do in Firefox 4 or Chrome.

**As a Facebook client**

I probably don&#8217;t use Facebook enough to judge this well. Having two widgets instead of tabs in one widget seems silly. It doesn&#8217;t keep itself very up-to-date, either, and seems slightly less functional than my phone. Again, I think I&#8217;d just leave Facebook open in a pinned tab.

**Ultimately&#8230;**

After using RockMelt for just a day, there are a few things I would like to see (not just in RockMelt).

  * **Better Gmail integration**. An unread message count just doesn&#8217;t do it for me anymore.
  * **Google Talk integration**. I don&#8217;t use Facebook Chat, but do use Google Talk. It would add a lot of value for me.
  * **Google Voice integration**. I don&#8217;t use it (yet) but it&#8217;s potentially a high-value addition.
  * **Atom Publish Protocol support**. Support for APP is disappointingly low, in general, but the option to post to my WordPress blog would be a great &#8220;Share&#8221; option. Also for F1.
  * **Bookmark(let)s on the right side**. Along with the RSS widgets, sticking a &#8220;Share on Tumblr&#8221; or &#8220;bit.ly&#8221; bookmarklet, for example, would open up a lot more services.
  * **Better UI for F1**. I realize Mozilla&#8217;s F1 is a pretty early prototype, but I&#8217;d like to see the UI improve in a few ways: 
      * **Smaller**. F1 is pretty big; I don&#8217;t need that much space for a Tweet.
      * **Less obtrusive**. Rather than opening along the entire top of the page, pushing down the content, something similar to RockMelt&#8217;s &#8220;Share&#8221; button or Firefox 4&#8217;s doorhanger notifications would stay out of the way.
      * **Faster**. I get the impression F1 is loading remote content for its UI and I have no idea why.
  * **Post everywhere**. This applies to RockMelt and F1, but I&#8217;d like to be able to update Facebook and Twitter simultaneously.

I would also totally use a Firefox add-on that gave me a RockMelt-style thin sidebar for Google Talk. [Yoono][5] might be close, I&#8217;ll give it a shot.

The experience of RockMelt is definitely evolutionary rather than revolutionary, at least if you&#8217;re used to interacting with these services regularly. I don&#8217;t feel like it adds significant value over the native services or Firefox with the right add-ons, but I do think it has some good ideas for UX in the space, that should be further developed.
