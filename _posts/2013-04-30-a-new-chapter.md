Nearly four years ago, I [moved West][1] to join Mozilla.

About a year later, I [moved East][2] to come home to New York.

I consider those two of the best changes I&#8217;ve ever made. Now Spring is here again and it&#8217;s time for another change. Last week, I announced to the company that **I am leaving Mozilla** this week.

Mozilla and I have grown so much over the past few years&mdash;and not just &#8220;bigger&#8221;. I&#8217;m incredibly proud of the team I leave behind, and of what we&#8217;ve achieved over the past few years. Mozilla and my team, especially [morgamic][3], have had a huge impact on me. And [for my part][4], looking back, I&#8217;ve had a pretty solid impact there.

I am excited for this change. It&#8217;s springtime in New York&mdash;as a metaphor, that is almost too pregnant. Honestly, it&#8217;s just beautiful here. Time to go outside.
