*NB: This is the ninth post in a [series][1] of posts on web application security.*

Rounding out this week is the last, but perhaps most important part of the **basic** security series: staying up to date.

Keeping everything up-to-date is a pain. You have to follow the latest versions of everything you use. And when things *just work*, it&#8217;s hard to justify taking the time to upgrade part of it and make them *just work* again.

Too bad: **it&#8217;s critical**. A lot of the Django features I mentioned are only in Django 1.4. Though for the big things, like `X-Frame-Options`, writing or [finding][2] code for older versions isn&#8217;t too hard.

But the small version increases, the 0.0.1 bumps, those contain [important][3] [security fixes][4], and rarely break backwards compatibility.

  1. Stay as up-to-date as you can. Don&#8217;t end up on a deprecated major revision or version.
  2. Absolutely keep the patch-level up-to-date. That&#8217;s where security fixes land. Not just in Django or Rails, but in lots of little libraries you&#8217;ve probably forgotten about.

Next week, we&#8217;ll dive into some more advanced gotchas and security issues, mostly from my own experience over the past couple of years. Until then, have a great weekend, and don&#8217;t forget to lock your doors.
