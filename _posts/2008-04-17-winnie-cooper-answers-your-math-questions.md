Remember [Winnie Cooper][1]? From the Wonder Years? Yes you do.

This may be old news to you, but the actress, Danica McKellar, has a BS in Math (just like me!). What&#8217;s weirder is that she [answers math questions on her site][2]. (You have to click on &#8220;Mathematics&#8221; on the left. It&#8217;s in a frame, boo.)

That is awesome beyond words.

So far she&#8217;s done a good deal of high school calculus and algebra, some physics, and proved that sqrt(5) is irrational.

She also wrote a book, [Math Doesn&#8217;t Suck][3], which *may* be heavily influenced by Cosmo. I don&#8217;t know, I haven&#8217;t read it.
