In late 2008 or early 2009, [Ben][1] and I were in a recurring status meeting—these days we&#8217;d call it a stand-up—that tended to run long.

So we mashed up his designs and a little JavaScript and put up NextUp, a [PTI][2]-inspired way to agree on a schedule ahead of time and stick to it.

And then we more or less forgot about it. It&#8217;s gotten a steady stream of very few people using it, but it&#8217;s not particularly important to either of us anymore, five years later. So it&#8217;s time to let it go.

As of around February 23rd, the domain NextUp.info will expire and the website will shut down. In exchange, we&#8217;ve put the code up on [GitHub][3]. If it&#8217;s important to you, please fork, use, and love it.
