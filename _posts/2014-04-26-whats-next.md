Friday was my last day at Bitly. Starting now, I am concentrating on [TodaysMeet][1].

TodaysMeet has been a side project of mine for a long time, and lived for several years without much input or attention from me. Recently, though, it&#8217;s been growing, and I have been spending more time with it. The more time I spend with it, the more time I want to.

I believe in TodaysMeet as a product, and that it can be truly transformative for students and classrooms.

Over the past year, I&#8217;ve heard more and more from teachers who love and use TodaysMeet, but the most compelling are those who say it has helped engage students who don&#8217;t raise their hands. TodaysMeet gives those students a voice, and they, more than anyone, deserve more from the product than I have been able to put into it.

I also believe TodaysMeet is showing its age, and the time to invest in it is now. Fortunately, the work I&#8217;ve done over [the past year and a half][2] has put the platform in a good place. Now the next steps need more time and focus, and so that is what I am giving them.

I&#8217;m so excited to be taking this step and looking forward to what&#8217;s next.
