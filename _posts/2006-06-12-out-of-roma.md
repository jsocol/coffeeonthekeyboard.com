I went to Ostia yesterday. It&#8217;s amazing. If you come for the Roman Empire, go to Ostia, don&#8217;t plan to spend too much time in Rome. The Christians have destroyed so much.

Blogger doesn&#8217;t work well in Europe, so I&#8217;m just saying that I&#8217;m off to Florence (Firenze) this afternoon.

Ciao!
