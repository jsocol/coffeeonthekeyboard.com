Happy Summer!

Last week saw some good work done on the Support Questions for 2.2, and we now believe we&#8217;ve ironed out the issues that we saw during the 2.1 push—one of them was actually a [Django bug][1] we fixed by upgrading.

**Last week**

  * Helped come up with a solution to the issues with 2.1.
  * Reviewed some UI work on 2.2.
  * Worked with IT to get replication in staging.
  * Got a plan together for a better staging environment early next quarter.
  * Helped Josh with a lightning talk topic for the Summit.
  * Worked on a plan for Q3, and goals with the team.
  * Worked with our stats provider.
  * Pushed out 1.5.4.2 (née 1.5.5.1) a minor update.

**This week (me)**

  * Get 2.1 out the door and 2.2 on staging.
  * Finish out a Q3 plan after working with the SUMO team.
  * Finish working with our stats provider.
  * Dig into some proper 2.2 bugs.
  * Focus more on the message I&#8217;m sending.
  * I&#8217;d really like to dig into Fantasai&#8217;s [question about ellipses][2] some more.

**This week (team)**

  * Push 2.1.
  * Finish the AAQ form.
  * Finish the answering process.
  * Demo the normal beginning-to-end workflow on staging.
