*Disclaimer: My opinion, not my employers, blah blah. You know the drill.*

Every once in a while, something happens that makes a few people scream: &#8220;If only *everyone* used WebKit, everything would be so much better.&#8221;

I have two problems with this. One you&#8217;ve heard a hundred times (monoculture is bad). The other you hear less often, because it pokes a hole in the &#8220;one rendering engine&#8221; pipe dream:

**There will never be one rendering engine.**

Chrome is now [forking WebKit][1] because, well, who cares why, they are forking. Any of a thousand reasons could be legitimate.

Imagine a world where everyone came together and said &#8220;you know what, it&#8217;s best for the web, let&#8217;s all agree on (this one particular flavor of) WebKit.&#8221; (Yes, that would mean we no longer care about our entire standardization process, but, this is a thought experiment.)

Now imagine that world two years later.

Nobody agrees on anything *now*. What the hell would happen if we were all working on the same code base.

I give 6 months as the over/under on someone forking this &#8220;one true rendering engine.&#8221;

Maybe it would be security or architecture concerns, like Chrome. Maybe a feature no one else wants to implement (WebSQL/IndexedDB, depending on which side your on). Maybe mobile performance or memory usage. Maybe project governance&mdash;we open source geeks do love to fight.

Any of a thousand reasons.

And there&#8217;s one.
