We&#8217;ve got a new page on the Mozilla Web Dev blog about [getting involved][1].

On it, you&#8217;ll find information about some of our biggest projects, including [Addons][2] and [Support][3]. There are links to the project pages on the [Mozilla Wiki][4], names of people to contact including IRC handles, and links to the source, tests and bug lists.

This page is a starting point. At the bottom you&#8217;ll find a link to a list of (hopefully) [all the websites we maintain][5].
