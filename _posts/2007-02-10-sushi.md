I love Sushi. Even more than that, I love being the type of person who eats sushi.

One of the few local restaurants around here, completely independent, is a sushi place down the street called Q Sushi. It&#8217;s run by a family, I think they&#8217;re Korean but I&#8217;m not positive, and they really roll some quality fish.

It&#8217;s not as &#8220;nice&#8221; as some of the other places around here, but it&#8217;s cheap, it&#8217;s fast, and it tastes good. And it&#8217;s the closest. What more could you want?

On an unrelated note&#8230; Only having one hoodie (and one or two long-sleeve t-shirts) is starting to bore me, so tomorrow I think I&#8217;m wandering down to the vintage store and/or Urban Outfitters.
