A debate has cropped up over &#8220;designed by&#8221; links, those (hopefully) little links a designer puts on a page to take credit and get themselves some traffic and customers.

On the one side, [Pat Dryburgh argues][1] word-of-mouth is superior to self-advertising: **&#8220;If the design is good enough, they will ask my clients, and if they like me enough, then they will tell people about me.&#8221;**

In rebuttal, [Sophia Lucero at wisdump.com claims][2] your &#8220;designed by&#8221; link should be like a Louis Vuitton logo: **&#8220;Your brand should never hurt your creations, it should enhance them&#8221;**.

To me, there is an issue of &#8220;ownership&#8221; to consider. If I put my name on something, I take responsibility for it as much as credit. My name means &#8220;I did this, I&#8217;m proud of it, and I want to be associated with it.&#8221; I think we&#8217;ve all done work we&#8217;ve left our names off, because we were rushed or a client demanded changes in spite of our best advice or&#8230; well, you get the idea: we weren&#8217;t proud of it.

So what do you do? Are you a &#8220;designed by&#8221; designer? Do you stick to code comments? What if you&#8217;re a back-end developer?

**Edit:** I should link [Chris Brogan&#8217;s series][3] [on personal][4] [branding][5]. It definitely applies to this question.
