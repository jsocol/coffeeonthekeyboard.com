2010 was the best year for music, for me, since 2007.

I&#8217;m not very good about listening to music, honestly: I don&#8217;t actively search for new music much anymore; I usually listen while working, only occasionally to I sit and *listen* to an album. Reading [Laura&#8217;s top 40 albums of 2010][1] made me start to realize how much I missed last year.

Still, through the help of some friends, I did find a bunch of new artists I enjoy.

The rules for this unordered list are: the album was released in 2010, I first listened to it in 2010, and [*All Day*][2] is disqualified. I&#8217;m not even going to attempt an order or a single &#8220;best of,&#8221; but I&#8217;m going to restrict myself to 5 albums.

(It&#8217;s disqualified because I could probably just leave it on a loop until the end of time and be perfectly happy. It isn&#8217;t fair.)

## <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transit/dp/B003WZ63AG/ref=dm_ap_alb1" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" title="Transit Transit" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41qQy0jVmJL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="168" /></a>Autolux &#8211; Transit Transit

I discovered [Autolux][3] when my friend [Heather][4] dragged me to a show at [Great American Music Hall][5]. I hadn&#8217;t heard of them, but I was excited when I found out [This Will Destroy You][6] was opening. Two weeks later when I went to the show at the [Bowery Ballroom][7], I was there for Autolux.

This is just really well-constructed indie rock. I particularly like the drumming from Carla Azar, but it&#8217;s an all-around good sound. I haven&#8217;t listened to 2008&#8217;s [Future Perfect][8] yet, but Transit Transit has elements of [Air][9], of a post-rock group like This Will Destroy You or even [Mogwai][10], and of &#8220;indietronica.&#8221; I&#8217;m a fan.

## <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forgiveness-Rock-Record/dp/B003FBUMJA/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1293915076&sr=301-1" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" title="Forgiveness Rock Record" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61uvqSzdJ3L._SL500_AA280_.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="168" /></a>Broken Social Scene &#8211; Forgiveness Rock Record

I doubt [Broken Social Scene][11] is capable of producing an album I won&#8217;t like. While it doesn&#8217;t surpass 2005&#8217;s [self-titled release][12] or 2002&#8217;s [You Forgot It in People][13]—really, what does? *Anthems* is one of my favorite songs of all time—it&#8217;s still a fantastic album. The opening track, *World Sick*, and *Texico Bitches* stand out as examples of why I love this group.

I got to see them, sans most of the girls, who were touring separately, at one of the last [SummerStage][14] shows of the year. (One of [my photos][15] even made it to [NYMag][16]&#8216;s weekly roundup!) As always, they put on a great show, eschewing the mandatory &#8220;encore&#8221; and just not leaving the stage for 2 hours.

A new BSS record is a good sign for any year. This one really came through and I love it.

## <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lady-Killer-Explicit/dp/B00492JOMU/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1293915765&sr=301-1" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" title="The Lady Killer" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MYj39xLAL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="168" /></a>Cee-Lo &#8211; The Lady Killer

If [Al Green][17] and [Jamiroquai][18] had a wonderful love child, it would sound like [Cee-Lo][19].

I was never particularly into [Gnarls Barkley][20]. I mean, I love *Crazy*, like everyone else in America, but I haven&#8217;t listened to much else, so Cee-Lo sort of came out of nowhere for me. My introduction was the [alternative video][21] created by&#8230; someone. I&#8217;m sorry, I wish I knew who. (If you know, comment and I&#8217;ll update this.) The [official video][22] is great, but I honestly found the &#8220;word&#8221; video to be brilliantly conceived and executed.

While the album as a whole starts strong and then tapers off a bit, I absolutely love the [Band of Horses][23] cover, *No One&#8217;s Gonna Love You*, that rounds it out.

## <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-Manor/dp/B0035VLGE0/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1293916612&sr=301-1" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" title="Gorilla Manor" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61qyda3xn1L._SL500_AA280_.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="168" /></a>Local Natives &#8211; Gorilla Manor

Another show a friend whose name starts with &#8220;L&#8221; convinced me to go to. I don&#8217;t even think I&#8217;d heard of [Local Natives][24] until the day of the show. I really love the guitar tone and melody these guys use. Like Autolux, they have great percussion work but here the other instruments have less of a post-rocky &#8220;noise&#8221; quality and it feels more balanced between all the voices.

Since I usually listen to whole albums, individual track names are sometimes hard for me to pull out. I like this whole album, but if I had to pick a standout moment, *World News* would probably be it.

They also put on an excellent live show. Next time they&#8217;re back in town, I&#8217;ll definitely be there.

## <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Treats/dp/B003P72KGC/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1293917190&sr=301-1" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" title="Treats" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FvmKX2JQL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="168" /></a>Sleigh Bells &#8211; Treats

The most frustrating musical discovery this year was [Sleigh Bells][25], because I first heard this album the day after they left Brooklyn on tour.

This is aggressively electronic rock. It&#8217;s loud and driving, even when technically the tempo isn&#8217;t that high. Alexis Krauss&#8217; vocal work is excellent. I dig the hyper-produced sound and the way they use the drum machine to blend traditional percussion instruments with less common percussive sounds. Labels like &#8220;lo-fi&#8221; and &#8220;synth-pop&#8221; are correct but don&#8217;t really capture the sound.

The standout tracks here are probably *Tell &#8216;Em*, *Infinity Guitars*, and *A/B Machines*. They&#8217;re all constructed very differently, but still deliver on the sound and energy. I really want to see Sleigh Bells live.

## Honorable Mentions

I said I&#8217;d limit this to 5, and that was tricky. I really wanted six, but I realized that while I listen to some of these honorable mentions more than some of the above (Sleigh Bells, for example, requires a kind of specific mood) that didn&#8217;t mean I liked them more. Here&#8217;s a random number of other great albums from 2010:

  * [Arcade Fire][26] &#8211; **[The Suburbs][27]**. I&#8217;m sure everyone in the world has already heard this. If not, come out of your cave (with internet access) and give it a listen. And check out [The Wilderness Downtown][28].
  * [Danger Mouse & Sparklehorse][29] &#8211; [**Dark Night of the Soul**][30]. It bounces around a little but it&#8217;s all good.
  * [Frontier Ruckus][31] &#8211; [**Deadmalls and Nightfalls**][32]. It&#8217;s not my favorite genre, but it&#8217;s well done and a good listen. And I know Zach (if he remembers me).
  * [Lost in the Trees][33] &#8211; [**All Alone In An Empty House**][34]. Again, not my usual cup of tea, but really well done, and I love the string sections.
  * [MotherMoon][35] &#8211; [**Writing in the Sky**][36]. It&#8217;s only a 5-track EP but it&#8217;s really good and shows a lot of promise.
  * [The Octopus Project][37] &#8211; [**Hexadecagon**][38]. I went to see [Starfucker][39] but after The Octopus Project opened, they were sort of a letdown. Great electronic album.
  * [Stars][40] &#8211; **[The Five Ghosts][41]**. Not the best Stars album, but I listen to it a lot because it&#8217;s got some good stuff.
