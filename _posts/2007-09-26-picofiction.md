[Picofiction][1] is new project: telling stories in 140 characters.

Picofiction is a combination of [microfiction][2], text messaging and [Twitter][3]. If you can write a story in a two-page spread, and tell the world what you&#8217;re doing in 140 characters, maybe you can tell a story in 140 characters.

#### Why 140?

140 characters is the length of a standard text message. Text messaging has its own vocabulary to deal with the limit, but story telling can be even more flexible with words.

The site is up and running and you can [start sharing stories][4] right now! Some features haven&#8217;t been finished yet but I&#8217;m working on it.

And remember that this Saturday is MSU&#8217;s [Technology Conference 2007][5]. If you&#8217;re a teacher in Michigan you should come!
