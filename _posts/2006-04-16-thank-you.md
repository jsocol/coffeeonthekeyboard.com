My wonderful Grandmother offered to buy my Eurail pass, which saved me almost $650 and let me get a decent camera to take on the trip, as well as letting me live just a little more comfortably, so <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thank you, Grandma</span>.

Other than that the trip is still on as planned. I haven&#8217;t had to do too much lately, but I changed my reservation for the second stay in Dublin from Abraham House to Ashfield House, which I hear better things about and is much more central to the city (though it&#8217;s probably a difference of 5 instead of 10 minutes walking).

Still trying to meet up with as many people as I can while I&#8217;m there, including my buddies JD in Dublin, Spencer in Paris, and my German brother Christian in Berlin.
