So I finally got around to doing the redesign. I based this somewhat on WordPress&#8217;s site and default templates, because they were a great example of the style I wanted: a more web-professional look with a print-inspired feel.

I&#8217;ve heard rumors and whispers that, while serif fonts are easier to read on paper, sans-serif fonts are easier to read on screens. I don&#8217;t really know where this comes from or if it&#8217;s true. I find that I can read 6- or 8-point Times New Roman but I get fuzzy below 10-point Arial, so I decided to use serif fonts.

Lower-case letters are very stylish and "en vogue" at the moment, and I like the way my name looks, so I&#8217;ve decided to drop the case for now.
