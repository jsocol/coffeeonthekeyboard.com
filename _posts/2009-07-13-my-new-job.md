I&#8217;m very excited to announce my new job: starting next month, I will be on the Web Development team at Mozilla.

    I am out in Mountain View right now, looking for an apartment, meeting my future boss—in person, we&#8217;ve spoken on the phone several times—and more of the web team, and checking out the area and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/osunick/sets/72157619367256703/">new offices</a>.

    I&#8217;m incredibly honored to be working with a group of people dedicated to making the internet a better place, and to have the opportunity to help improve products I use every day.

    Of course, I&#8217;m also excited to be moving into the heart of Silicon Valley, in a beautiful area with fantastic weather, near a great city like San Francisco. It&#8217;s a bit of change from Michigan!
