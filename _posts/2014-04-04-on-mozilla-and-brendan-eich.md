Two things have been clear to me for the past week:

Losing Brendan from the Mozilla organization and community is a terrible blow, and we&#8217;re all worse off for it.

Brendan could not continue as CEO.

It feels cheap and easy to talk about this now, as if to say &#8220;oh yeah, I felt this way the whole time.&#8221; But until Brendan stepped down, I had a very hard time deciding how I felt.

I worked at Mozilla in a technical role for nearly four years, while Brendan was CTO. I have had the privilege of meeting and talking with Brendan several times and, as acquaintances go, I&#8217;ve always liked him. I still absolutely consider myself a Mozillian, a Firefox user and Open Web advocate.

I&#8217;m sad that Brendan&#8217;s views on marriage equality haven&#8217;t changed. Or at least I assume they haven&#8217;t, because if they had, it would have been a very easy way out of this: &#8220;I was wrong, and I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;

I&#8217;m sad that the choices, then, came down to damage the organization by leaving or damage it by staying. Even though I think he picked the path of least damage.

I&#8217;m sad that Brendan is leaving the community.

I&#8217;m scared that [the Open Web may be viewed as a liberal or libertarian cause][1], and will suffer for it.

I&#8217;m concerned that people [see Mozilla the same way they see Chick-Fil-A][2], and that there&#8217;s so much work to do just educating people on what Mozilla is.

I&#8217;m worried that Mozilla is, again, without a CEO. And simultaneously without 3 Corporation board members and one Foundation board member.

I&#8217;m happy that [Mozilla is a messy, open place][3] where this kind of discussion is in public, no matter how much easier it may have been to have in private.

I hope the community can heal, and FirefoxOS can win.

Ultimately, [Brendan couldn&#8217;t lead][4] the organization through this, and so I think his stepping down was the better of the options he left himself. This was [a Pyrrhic &#8220;victory&#8221;][5]. (Hampton and Michael Catlin have been particularly thoughtful and eloquent the past week; their posts are worth reading.)

And to all my friends, colleagues, and fellow Mozillians, I&#8217;m standing with you, the organization, and the mission.
