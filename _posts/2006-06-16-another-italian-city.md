This makes my 6th city in Italy, meaning I&#8217;ve traveled more extensively here than anywhere else in Europe. I am in Genova at the moment.

I decided to leave Cinque Terre early this morning instead of staying another day. I was very sunburned and I think I would rather go to the beach for an afternoon every weekend than for several days in a row. Michigan, by the way, has better beaches than Cinque Terre. The beaches of Lake Michigan really are world-class, with brilliant yellow sand and fresh, warm water. It&#8217;s hard to imagine but in this small way, West Michigan really is top-flight spot.

So I took an early train and ended up talking with a girl from Chicago who missed the earlier train and is right now trying to rearrange a flight to London to take a plane home. She&#8217;s leaving for Milan soon, and I&#8217;m going to stay here for the day then head to Milan to start (or continue) the most complicated route from Cinque Terre to Berlin ever&#8211;and it&#8217;s not very easy in the first place.

Normally you would have to go Cinque Terre &#8211;> Genova &#8211;> Milan &#8211;> (Frankfurt or Zurich &#8211;> Munich) &#8211;> Berlin, or Cinque Terre &#8211;> La Spezia &#8211;> Florence &#8211;> Milan, etc&#8230; I, however, am going Cinque Terre &#8211;> Genova &#8211;> Milan &#8211;> Frankfurt &#8211;> Mannheim &#8211;> Kaiserslautern &#8211;> Mannheim &#8211;> Frankfurt &#8211;> Berlin. Fortunately the trains in Germany are fast.

So now I think I&#8217;m going to enjoy some connectivity and chill in an urban area for a few hours, maybe learn a bit about (now honorary) citizen Christopher Columbus. It&#8217;s exciting, I know. I just missed the city, so I&#8217;m in one now. And why not check out yet another town?

When I get back, I will do several real posts with all sorts of information about all the people I&#8217;ve met. In the meantime read Justin LaHart in the Wall Street Journal or on [cnnmoney.com][1]. He&#8217;s a nice guy.
