I give a lot—well, I give some—talks, but I never give the slides out.

And, as far as I can remember, no one has ever asked for them.

I know people, [people who speak a lot more than me][1], who put all their slide decks up. Why wouldn&#8217;t I do that? What makes me think I&#8217;m so special?

It&#8217;s about my style of speaking, the kind of impression I want to make, and [the types of slide decks I build][2]. If I do it all correctly, the slides themselves will be *completely useless* to you. At best, they might jog your memory about something, but there are much better ways to do that.

The slides aren&#8217;t the story, not by themselves. The slides are half the story. I&#8217;m telling you the other half.

That&#8217;s not to say there isn&#8217;t going to be information in my talk. There will be. And it&#8217;ll be valuable and important, or they wouldn&#8217;t have let me give the talk, and you wouldn&#8217;t have come. And I want you to get back at that information later, after the talk, too.

But I want you to get the whole story. And the slides are only half the story. (Sometimes, the slides and the words combine to make a joke. I&#8217;d really hate for you to only get half of that.)

Most of my technical talks have one URL in them, it&#8217;s the last or second to last slide, and it&#8217;s where to get the story, in some other form. That one URL has all the links you need, all the projects I mentioned. And if I&#8217;ve had time, it has the whole story, just in text form.

*Edit:* There&#8217;s some good conversation happening over [on Hacker News][3], you might want to check that out, since people disagree with me.
