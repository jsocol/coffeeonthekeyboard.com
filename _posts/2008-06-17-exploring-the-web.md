Last week, as I was demonstrating [Ning][1] in my office, someone asked me how I find things like this. Honestly, I could not remember when or how I discovered Ning, which prompted me to pay attention over the past week, and to [ask you][2].

(It was also a good excuse to write a short post since I&#8217;m still recovering from some wrist strain.)

So what did I find in the past week or so, and where did I find it? Twitter, unsurprisingly, has been the best source, though not always directly. Second best is what I&#8217;ll call &#8220;secondary finds,&#8221; when I visit one project and then follow to the author&#8217;s other projects. Blogs were a close third.

I should admit that I didn&#8217;t keep notes or stats, but I&#8217;m fairly good at keeping track of things like this, so I trust my own numbers.

[CheckYesOrNo.info][3] is a nifty, Twitter-friendly site for yes-or-no poll questions like &#8220;[Will you participate in Mozilla&#8217;s FF3 Download Day June 17th?][4]&#8221; (Yes.) Found it when @[benrasmusen][5] tweeted a question.

[Issuu][6] is a publishing social network. They have some kinks to work out but I see definite potential here. Found it when my cousin tweeted a link.

[Twingly][7] is like [Technorati][8] reborn, a new, more focused blog search tool. Chris Brogan [blogged about it][9].

[LaterLoop][10] helps you store sites to read later. Very popular on Twitter.

[TimeToMeet.info][11] is from the same people as LaterLoop, and is a very slick multi-timezone meeting planner.

These are just some of the highlights of this week. I&#8217;ve perused quite a few little projects here and there, some good, some bad. I think there are three things that lead to discoveries like this:

**Keep your eyes open**. When people link something, check it out (or use LaterLoop and do it later).

If you see a link like http://checkyesorno.info/93, try getting rid of the &#8220;93&#8221; and visit the site itself. **Visit the site, not just the page.**

If you like a site, scroll down and look at the footer. Most projects, particularly by independent developers and small companies, have links to the developer&#8217;s site, which probably has links to other projects. **Look at their other projects**. If someone had one good idea and put it together, odds are they&#8217;ve had others.

Any more ideas from out there in the blogosphere?
