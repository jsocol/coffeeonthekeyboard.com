I &#8220;star&#8221; messages in Thunderbird pretty frequently as a reminder to go back and look at them. But it doesn&#8217;t usually work.

Why not? There is no easy way to go back and look at starred messages by default. I could resort each folder, looking for stars, but that&#8217;s annoying. I was hoping one of the Smart Folders would be &#8220;Starred Messages&#8221; but, sadly, I was wrong.

You can&#8217;t even easily search for starred messages!

But you can create a new saved search. Here&#8217;s how:

  1. Go to File > New > Saved Search&#8230;
  2. Name it something like &#8220;Starred&#8221;
  3. Set &#8220;Create as a subfolder of:&#8221; to wherever you&#8217;d like the folder to live.
  4. Click &#8220;Choose&#8221; to pick which folders to search.
  5. Change the filter to &#8220;Status&#8221; &#8220;is&#8221; &#8220;Starred&#8221;.
  6. Save it.

Then you can open your saved search in a new tab, or just leave it in the list of folders.
