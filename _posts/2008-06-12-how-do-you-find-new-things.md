In lieu of a guest post, I&#8217;m just going to ask a question:

What is your best source for finding new things on the web?

Do you rely on search engines and find what you need when you need it? Do you check out the sites linked by Twitter pals? Read 200 blogs?

And a follow-up: What&#8217;s the coolest thing (blog, app, service, whatever) you&#8217;ve found on the web this week?

I&#8217;ll post my answer as soon as my wrists heal.
