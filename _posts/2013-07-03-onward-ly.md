Later this month I will be joining the [Bitly][1] team!

I am *extremely* excited to be joining such an amazing group working on a product that touches so much of the web, one that I&#8217;ve used for years. I&#8217;ll be working on the Bitly API, and helping other people work with it, too. And whatever else needs doing that I can help with (small teams FTW).

There&#8217;s lots to do, wrap up, and finally get to in the next couple weeks before I get started, but I can&#8217;t wait!
