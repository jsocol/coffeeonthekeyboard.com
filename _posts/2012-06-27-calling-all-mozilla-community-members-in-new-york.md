Are you a *Mozillian*? Are you an add-on author or web developer or an avid Firefox user? Do you think of yourself as part of the **Mozilla Community**, and are you in or around New York City?

Then I&#8217;m talking to you!

We have a **[Meetup group][1]**. I&#8217;d love it if you joined it. We haven&#8217;t really done much yet, and, in real Mozilla fashion, I&#8217;d love the community itself&mdash;that&#8217;s *you*&mdash;to decide what kind of meetups we should have.

Come, join the group, let&#8217;s hang out!
