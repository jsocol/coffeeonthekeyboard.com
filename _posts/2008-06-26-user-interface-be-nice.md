<p class="note">
  A short post for a busy week.
</p>

I just downloaded the [Spore Creature Creator][1], and this file showed up on my desktop: **792248d6ad421d577132c2b648bbed45\_scc\_trial_na.exe**.

Why not &#8220;Spore Creature Creator Trial Install.exe&#8221;, or, if spaces aren&#8217;t your thing, &#8220;SporeCreatureCreatorTrialInstall.exe&#8221;? Either would be infinitely more meaningful than an MD5 hash followed by an acronym and a region code.

While the developers *may* have had a reason (though I can&#8217;t imagine it&#8217;s a good enough reason) to use this file name, the web team has no excuse.

There&#8217;s a lesson here: be nice to users. Whether it&#8217;s just a file name or [helpful error messages][2] or designing a user interface/experience, don&#8217;t treat your users like machines that parse your (bizarre) internal formats.

And Will Wright, if you&#8217;re listening, ask someone to rename that file.
