OK, in line with my [2011 goals][1] and because I&#8217;m sick of not remembering what I did last week, I&#8217;m restarting the weekly update posts. I hope you like hearing about the minutia of my job! (Just kidding. I write these for me.) I&#8217;m going to try a &#8220;sometime Friday&#8221; schedule instead of weekends or at night.

Also, this one will cover the last four-and-a-half-ish weeks, since it&#8217;s been a while.

  * Released [Bleach 1.0][2] to almost no fanfare. Still, it&#8217;s an improvement and you should upgrade.
  * Demoed [Waffle][3] at [Hack and Tell][4] to [moderate interest][5] and good feedback.
  * Started pushing [old][6] [projects][7] to Github. Next up? Old WordPress plugins.
  * Kinda/sorta released [Rasputin][8] and [Rasputin-Node][9] super-pre-alpha code.
  * Wrote [Django-DNT][10].
  * Wrote [Django AdminPlus][11]. ([blog post][12])
  * Was in Mountain View for three days, during which: 
      * Helped Luke put together a development [roadmap for MDN][13].
      * Agreed to help Sid put together a [Do-Not-Track demo][14].
      * Helped, for my part, [move SUMO to Phoenix][15].
      * Was interviewed on camera for [Rypple][16].
      * Interviewed an awesome intern candidate.
      * Went to [Alcatraz][17]. (It&#8217;s OK, they let me out.)
  * Released [SUMO 2.5][18]. [Nice work, team][19]!
  * Patched and released a quick [SUMO 2.5.1][20].
  * Release [SUMO 2.6][21].
  * Releasing [SUMO 2.6.1][22] on Tuesday.
  * Rolling on [SUMO 2.6.2][23]. Lots of reviews, lots of little things. 
      * Including an [API for Socorro][24] for our Post Crash experience.
  * Finished fixing [Hudson builds for our &#8220;next&#8221; branch][25].
  * Wrote up a design doc for a new SUMO feature.
  * Started planning out Q2, both our feature roadmap and our [Continuous Deployment progress][26].
