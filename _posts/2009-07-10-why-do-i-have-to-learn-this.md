Teachers, can you answer this question?

Can you do it without referencing the next class? Or a state standard?

Can you answer in terms your students can understand?

CanÂ  you be compelling? Excited?

Do you believe your own answer?

If not, do you have any right to teach this class? Or does the class need to be reinvented from the ground up?
