So many apartments around here, and the whole local method of *finding* apartments, are based on these out-of-the-city, suburb-light developments. I don&#8217;t want to live there.<!--more-->

I somehow managed to get the East Coast sense of what apartment living is. I like buildings without names, unique, or at least not carbon-copied a hundred times by some large corporation eating up what free land is left and contributing to urban sprawl without adding any *urbanity*.

Mixed neighborhoods and local stores. Families and yuppies and artists. Immigrants and seniors.

Brooklyn.

But I&#8217;m 1,000 miles from Brooklyn, and the problem with any apartment I find around here is that it, too, is in Mid-Michigan.

So I scour the papers and the internet, looking for something urban, something central to Lansing. I think it&#8217;s the best I can do.

Also, I actually wrote this post from a coffee shop. I think that&#8217;s a first on this blog.
