If I could&#8217;ve sat down with [Chris Brogan][1] and [Laura Fitton][2] six months ago and asked them one thing, it would have been: &#8220;Who, exactly, are you marketing to?&#8221;

There has always been a small thorn in my paw about social media marketing. It&#8217;s the same thing that bothers me when people come on TV and promise to help make you rich. All you have to do is&#8230; sell a book that promises to make people rich! It&#8217;s the same feeling I get when I read [Problogger][3] and wonder: &#8220;Do I want to listen to advice from a blog about blogging? Would I do better to listen to someone like [Jeff Atwood][4]?&#8221;<!--more-->

For months—years—the &#8220;social media space&#8221; has been dominated by, well, social media users. There are lots of people, from Brogan and Pistachio on down, promising to help you leverage tools like [Twitter][5]. But who was the audience on Twitter? Early-adopters. Geeks. Other &#8220;social media marketers.&#8221;

Of course Chris Brogan can sell himself on Twitter: it was his ideal audience. But when it comes to marketing the end product, who&#8217;s listening?

Twitter use has [skyrocketed][6] over the last 9 or 10 months. Once the morning shows started talking about Twitter (unfortunately, giving very [false impressions][7]) the cascade was probably inevitable. And the people who are joining now are not the same people who joined a year and a half ago.

The time for social media marketers—the real ones, dealing with consumers, not meta-marketers selling advice on selling—to prove themselves is **right now**.

This is your chance.

Prove to me that this can work; that what you do is worth it.

I don&#8217;t mean to pick on Chris Brogan. I&#8217;m sure his company, [CrossTech Media][8], has a portfolio of successful campaigns. What *doesn&#8217;t* impress me is convincing the early adopters of the potential of the space. If there&#8217;s a more apt example of &#8220;preaching to the choir,&#8221; I don&#8217;t know it.

There has been a reinforcement loop in this field. &#8220;We should follow Chris Brogan, he knows what he&#8217;s talking about!&#8221; &#8220;Chris Brogan has 18,000 followers, he must know what he&#8217;s talking about!&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll subscribe to Problogger because they&#8217;ll help me get more subscribers. They must be good, look how many subscribers they have!&#8221;

Now there is finally an opportunity to put all this theory into practice. Can you use Chris Brogan&#8217;s advice to build relationships on Twitter with people who aren&#8217;t already excited about building relationships on Twitter? Can you use Darren Rowse&#8217;s advice to build an audience of people who aren&#8217;t other bloggers?

If I could sit down with Chris Brogan and Laura Fitton and Darren Rowse *now*, I wouldn&#8217;t be asking &#8220;who is the audience.&#8221; I would just say &#8220;Ok, the audience is here. Now show me.&#8221;
