At Mozilla, our web development projects are open source, publicly available, and interested in community contributions.

This is one of those things that makes absolute sense when you hear it, but you may have never heard, or thought, of it before.

It&#8217;s not terribly well-publicized—that&#8217;s something [Mike Morgan][1] and I are going to start working on this week—but there are ways you can get involved:

  * There&#8217;s [info about most, if not all, our current projects on the Mozilla Wiki][2].
  * An [advanced search in Bugzilla][3] can tell you a lot about what&#8217;s going on.
  * You can find web dev people [on IRC][4] in #webdev, #sumodev, and a few others. (I&#8217;m jsocol on irc.mozilla.org.)

Why would you want to contribute to Mozilla web development projects?

  * You [care about the web][5], and making it better.
  * Our websites are used by [millions of people][6].
  * Because of that, we work at scales most developers don&#8217;t usually get to see.

Hopefully I&#8217;ll have something to add by the end of the week, but in the meantime, come on over and say &#8220;hi&#8221; on IRC!
