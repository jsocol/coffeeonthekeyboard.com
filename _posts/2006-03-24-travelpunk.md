Time to correct an injustice: I have gone far too long without mentioning a great website, a hell of a community, and some of the best backpackers I know: everybody at [TravelPUNK.com][1]. The people on there have helped me with so many of the little stupid questions you wouldn&#8217;t even know where to start looking for answers to. (What kind of batteries do they use in Europe? What&#8217;s the voltage range on a Canon SD400 charger?)

Just wanted to say thanks to everyone there and encourage anyone who is traveling, was traveling, or is thinking of traveling to check it out!

I&#8217;ll update on the trip soon.
