I haven&#8217;t made a New Year&#8217;s Resolution in years. They&#8217;re arbitrary, often unmeasurable, and usually people make it 1-12 weeks and give up. Kind of depressing.

But, recently I&#8217;ve realized how beneficial goal-setting can be. The key is to accept and understand failure, and learn from it. If you meet all of your goals, you&#8217;re not pushing yourself and not growing.

So I&#8217;m going to set goals for 2011. To push myself.

  * [**Project 365**][1]. Inspired by [Fred][2], I&#8217;m going to try to be more proactive about photography, and take and share a photo every day.
  * **Write at least once per week**. I want to write something on this blog once a week this year. It can be personal, professional, even just the weekly update posts. Just keep writing.
  * **Cook most of my food**. I figure there are probably 19-21 meals per week, depending how late I sleep on Saturdays. I&#8217;d like to make 14 of them. I spend too much money on food and should really learn to cook, anyway.

These are all more or less creative pursuits: guess which part of my life I feel like I&#8217;ve been neglecting. I&#8217;ll also accept some ramp-up period with all of these, especially the cooking one.

I&#8217;m also making a couple less measurable resolutions, but I&#8217;m keeping those to myself.

Do you have any goals or resolutions for 2011?
