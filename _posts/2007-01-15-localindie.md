I find myself in an interesting position, music-wise. On the one hand, I don&#8217;t <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> have a radio in my car, all I can listen to is NPR and MMQ, the classic rock station. So I haven&#8217;t really heard a lot of new music lately. On the other hand, some stuff is so whiny that even if it&#8217;s otherwise good, I can&#8217;t take it.

I am firmly of the opinion that one should neither jump on bandwagons and listen to things (or do things, or eat things, etc) just because everyone else is doing it. I am also firmly of the opinion that just because something is popular doesn&#8217;t make it bad, in fact it&#8217;s probably popular for a reason. (Cynically, because this is what the record exec&#8217;s decided to make popular; optimistically, because it&#8217;s decent.)

What does this have to do with me? Well, I&#8217;m trying to expand my musical horizons. So I&#8217;m using [Last.fm][1], an amazing place, to try to find new bands. The problem is that, currently, most of the music I&#8217;m listening to is very well-known/main-stream. (Even bands that I liked before they were popular and now aren&#8217;t popular anymore, like Third Eye Blind.) So, of course, it&#8217;s only recommending other popular/well-known bands, most of which I&#8217;ve heard.

That&#8217;s not fair: it also suggested I&#8217;d like Ricky Gervais&#8217; podcasts on The Guardian, which I&#8217;m sure I will.

So how do I get it to recommend things I haven&#8217;t heard of before? I need to listen to things I&#8217;ve never heard of before. That&#8217;s a hell of a catch-22.

But this goes beyond just what music I listen to. I want to make more of an effort to make sure I take advantage of locality. There are places here that aren&#8217;t national chains, and even a few that aren&#8217;t chains at all. Clearly I need to spend more time at places like that. Screw off, Starbucks.
