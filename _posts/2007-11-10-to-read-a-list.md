Norman Mailer died today.

It doesn&#8217;t matter much to me. I didn&#8217;t know him. I&#8217;d never read any of his books. I rarely read any of his articles or columns, and then only when we crossed paths on the internet.

</p>

But I have not been reading lately, and the death of such a well-known author did give me cause to think about literature and reading in general. Soon, if the next month goes well, I will suddenly find myself with more free time than I have had in the last 42 months: I will be a college graduate with a 9-5 job and a few friends still in class.

In those 42 months, I have developed a nasty habit of spending my free time idly at my computer; scouring the vast emptiness of the internet for interesting things to read or to see and occasionally talking to real-live humans. I want to break myself of this habit and nurture a new dependency on reading that other great invention: the book.

To that end, I&#8217;m starting a list of books I want to read, which is something I should have done years ago. Below I am reproducing this list as an open call for additions and suggestions. This is in no particular order and is based only on what I&#8217;ve read recently.

  * *The Name of the Rose** Umberto Eco.
  * *The 42nd Parallel* John Dos Passos.
  * *1919* John Dos Passos.
  * *The Big Money* John Dos Passos.
  * *The Naked and the Dead* Norman Mailer.
  * *Armies of the Night* Norman Mailer.
  * *The Executioner* Norman Mailer.
  * *One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#8217;s Nest* Ken Kesey.
  * *The Odyssey* tr. Stanley Lombardon.
  * *The Unbearable Lightness of Being** Milan Kundera.
  * *Carrie* Stephen King.
  * *William Marshall** Georges Duby.
  * *Studs Lonigan* James T. Farrell.
  * *Moby Dick** Herman Melville.
  * *L&#8217;Ã‰tranger (in French)* Albert Camus.
  * *The Plague* Albert Camus.
  * *Pale Fire* Vladimir Nabokov.
  * *Camera Obscura* Vladimir Nabokov.

<p class="note">
  An * means I&#8217;ve already started the book.
