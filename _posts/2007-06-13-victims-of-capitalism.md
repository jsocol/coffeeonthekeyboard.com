In the spirit of the [Victims of Communism][1] memorial being unveiled in Washington, I think we should design and build a monument to the hundreds of millions&mdash;billions&mdash;of people who have died as a result of capitalism. It should be appropriately scaled.

We can build a &#8220;Victims of Socialism&#8221; monument, too, for completeness. These are mostly people who suffer through the UK&#8217;s sorely underfunded health care system.

Of course, your typical American history class, and hence your typical American adult, draws no distinction between *communism*, a centrally-controlled economy in which all citizens are equal owners, and an *authoritarian dictatorship*, such as, for instance, Russia under Stalin.

The question of whether or not communism can succeed on any meaningful scale is a long-standing one, which has been the source of much debate. But anyone with a clear understanding of civics can understand that these people were not victims of an abstract economic theory, but of corrupt and brutal leaders.
