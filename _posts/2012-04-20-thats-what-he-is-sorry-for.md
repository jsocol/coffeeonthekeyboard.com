Two recent blog posts have called me on my bullshit and I owe everyone an apology.

First, Jessamyn Smith wrote about [Fighting Sexist Jokes the Geeky Way][1], and then Katie Cunningham—whom, though we&#8217;ve never met in person, I consider a friend from the Django community and Twitter—wrote about being told to [Lighten Up][2].

Neither of these were, as far as I know, directed at me, but I feel like they still effectively called me out on contributing to our culture the wrong way, with [scottbot][3].

Reading Jessamyn&#8217;s post (go read it, I&#8217;ll wait) I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if the original bot had been scottbot. And—selfish as this reaction may be—that didn&#8217;t make me feel good.

I&#8217;m not usually proactive about helping make open source more diverse and more friendly to diverse groups. I could make excuses but ultimately, even though it&#8217;s important to me, it&#8217;s never something I&#8217;ve put time into. But I&#8217;m not going to be proactive in making it worse, either.

Scottbot was an interesting programming question. &#8220;Can we make a bot that learns to make these jokes better?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t think about the broader implications. Not thinking about it is a big part of the privilege hegemonic groups have. I can&#8217;t go back in time and stop myself from writing it but I can recognize it, call it out, and take action.

  * First, I&#8217;m sorry.
  * Second, I&#8217;ve removed the scottbot repository from GitHub. I can&#8217;t, and wouldn&#8217;t, do anything about the existing forks, but I don&#8217;t have to keep distributing it. The code is so simple as to be really boring, and while the bot could be edited to say something else, why? There&#8217;s a limited set of use cases for a Bayesian response bot.
  * Third, I removed the scottbot package from the npm registry. With the recent password reset stuff on the registry, it took me a little while to figure out how to log in again. But it&#8217;s gone now.

Scottbot was my copyright under the [WTFPL][4], so people who have it can still distribute it, but I&#8217;d ask them to think about it, first, and think if they&#8217;re contributing to the right kind of culture but using or distributing the code.
