Well there have been a few changes in the past month. But on the other hand, I actually have some tickets purchased and some hostels booked. Here&#8217;s the current itinerary:

  * 18 May &#8212; Arrive in Dublin
  * 22 May &#8212; Flight to Paris
  * 17 June &#8212; Arrive in Berlin
  * 21 June &#8212; Flight to Liverpool
  * 24 June &#8212; Flight to Dublin
  * 28 June &#8212; Depart Dublin for Chicago

And I&#8217;ve booked hostels in Dublin and Liverpool. I&#8217;m still staying with my friend in Berlin. It&#8217;s pretty exciting, to actually have plane tickets, reservations, to know for absolute sure that I&#8217;m committed and going.

So what insight have I gleaned? It costs almost exactly US$100 to get from Berlin to Liverpool, no matter how you do it. I tried flying to London Stansted (RyanAir) and taking a train&#8211;about $100. Flying to East Midlands (near Nottingham &#8211; Ryanair) and taking a shorter train&#8211;about $100. So I decided to just fly direct (Schoenfeld to John Lennon &#8211; EasyJet) and save the trouble&#8211;$100. Weird, but that&#8217;s what it costs.

I also booked space in the Abraham House hostel for the two legs in Dublin. Nice-looking place. Across the river from Trinity and Temple Bar. I&#8217;m staying at the Embassie in Liverpool. I&#8217;ve heard great things, it&#8217;s really cheap, and they&#8217;re super nice! I&#8217;ll have recommendations when I come back.

As for getting around: RyanAir rules. EasyJet looks nicer, but is more expensive. And they don&#8217;t fly as many places. But there are lots of cheap airlines.
