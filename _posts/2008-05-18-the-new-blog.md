I made myself sit down today and finish work on the blog design. I am very happy with how it came out.<!--more-->

This design is a hybrid, pulling elements from some of better-looking sites and blogs. The three-column layout was inspired by Felicia Day&#8217;s &#8220;[Flog][1]&#8221; and [Problogger][2], the thin header comes from [a post on Chris Brogan&#8217;s blog][3], the heading style is cribbed from [The Guardian][4].

There are two things I learned here that I want to pass along.

**T****heft is not wrong**. Just because a design element exists on another site does not mean you can&#8217;t use it. I don&#8217;t mean you should steal the entire layout, images and all, or steal code (unless it&#8217;s under a free license, then steal away). But if you like the way your favorite blog does headings, there&#8217;s no shame in modeling your headings the same way.

**Unfinished *is* wrong.** I regret leaving the blog unfinished for so long. I would have been better served by using the Kubrick theme until I was really ready to switch. If you&#8217;re starting a blog and want to get to writing right away, go ahead and use some free templates. It&#8217;s much better than starting a theme and leaving it unfinished.

A corollary to that is &#8220;while incremental changes are fine in testing, only big, *complete* changes are OK in production.&#8221; In other words, don&#8217;t edit your live site, except small tweaks and bug fixes. When you upload new templates they should be tested and ready to deploy.

That being said, there are a few small things that aren&#8217;t quite finished. I need to write a short paragraph about myself and decide if I want to add a Problogger-/Chris Brogan-style link to the feed right at the top.

Well, what do you think?
