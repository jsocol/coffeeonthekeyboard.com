On a whim, I just downloaded the [Amazon MP3 Downloader][1]. My first "purchase"&mdash;a free example&mdash; was an Apples in Stereo track that may be some default or perhaps Amazon got it from my recommendations (they&#8217;re a decent band, and this will prompt me to give their last album another listen).

Then I bought a whole album, Aesop Rock&#8217;s *None Shall Pass*, on which I was old solely by the eponymous track&mdash;and the rest of which is, so far, just as good, definitely worth the purchase.

Because I was signed in to Amazon&mdash;flaunting real security for positional security, I&#8217;m always signed into everything&mdash;I was able to buy the album using Amazon&#8217;s One-Click. I hit a button, Amazon asked me to open a file with their downloader, and in under two minutes, I had the whole album, in beautiful 320kbps MP3, sans DRM.

Having traditionally preferred discs to digital, and shunning iTunes, the colossal flaw with the iPod, I was surprised how easy this was. My experiences with the old MSN Music store and it&#8217;s spiritual descendant Urge were nowhere near as easy or fast.

I think this album downloaded faster from Amazon than a single Dave Brubeck track from MSN, for example.

A very nice feature, with perhaps two flaws, is that the downloader will automatically add your purchases to either your iTunes or Windows Media library.

The only changes I would want are 1) the ability to add to both libraries simultaneously, and 2) the ability to customize the directory structure of the downloads. It would be nice if I could say "`%artist%\%album%\%num%-%artist%-%title%.mp3`" (and yes, I am aware I have a bizarre naming scheme, and yes, I assume everything uses WordPress style variables).

On the whole, this is a very pleasant entrant into the mêlée that is the music downloading business. You need to use Amazon&#8217;s oft-cluttered site to do your searching, but at least the familiar should be easy, and there&#8217;s no deep discount over other stores, Amazon&#8217;s well-known source of power. But the combination of speed, high quality tracks, Amazonian reputation and, most importantly, the utter lack of DRM, makes Amazon my immediate favorite.
