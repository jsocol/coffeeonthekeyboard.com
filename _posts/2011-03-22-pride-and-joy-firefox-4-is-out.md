Since it was officially released around 7 hours ago, [Firefox 4][1] has been downloaded nearly [2.4 million times][2].

I feel many things today. I&#8217;m deeply **proud** and **humbled** to be a part of the **Mozilla community** and contribute in my own small way to what I honestly believe is a fantastic product and the **best choice in web browsers** right now.

I&#8217;m filled with **joy** at seeing a product so many people have worked so hard on finally get released to everyone.

And I&#8217;m a little bit **sad** that I&#8217;m not in Mountain View for the release.

Finally, I&#8217;m **excited**, because just in the time I&#8217;ve been at Mozilla, the **web has gotten so much better**.

  * All the **modern browsers are [fast][3]**.
  * Browsers quickly** [getting][4] [more][5] [secure][6]**.
  * Modern browsers [are][7] **[so][8] [much][9] [more capable][10]**.

The future of the web is **bright**. There are challenges—not just for Firefox but for the web itself—but I&#8217;m confident we have the **ingenuity** and **passion** to overcome them.

So if you haven&#8217;t tried it yet, go get [**Firefox 4**][1], and **experience a better web**!

Here are my favorite parts:

  * App tabs.
  * Panorama.
  * WebGL.
  * Developer console.
  * Fast, fast, fast!
  * Tabs on top.
  * Switch to Tab.
  * Sync.
  * Restartless Add-ons.
