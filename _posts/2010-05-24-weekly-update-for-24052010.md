Last week was short and hectic, but turned out to be way more productive than expected (at least as a team, if not personally). It started with a long flight and getting Ricky and Josh started, and ended with [Pac Man][1] and lots of reviews.

**Last week**

  * Helped Ricky and Josh get Kitsune and enough of TikiWiki up and running.
  * Worked with Paul to figure out some [access control][2] questions.
  * [Reviewed a lot of stuff][3].
  * Helped keep SUMO up during the Pac Man incident.
  * Fixed [Hudson][4] builds and [staging][5] when new requirements caused problems.
  * Even fixed a [bug][6] today! (In [Bleach][7].)

**This week (me)  
**

  * Help Josh gather requirements for his summer project.
  * Coordinate string and code freeze for 2.1.
  * Keep review queue empty.
  * Finish the bugs that are assigned to me.

**This week (team)**

  * Get everything on track to freeze 2.1.
  * Get to zero known 500 errors.
