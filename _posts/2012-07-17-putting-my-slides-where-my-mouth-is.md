I&#8217;m giving a [talk tonight][1] at [GetGlue][2] on web app security, particularly with Django. Over the next several days&mdash;starting tonight&mdash;parts of that talk will be posted here as blog posts (I&#8217;ve realized there&#8217;s too much material for one post).

A while ago I said I didn&#8217;t like posting my slides because [the slides don&#8217;t tell the whole story][3]. So I&#8217;m going to try to tell the whole story another way.
