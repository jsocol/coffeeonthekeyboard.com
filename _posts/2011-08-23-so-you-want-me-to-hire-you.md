I vacillated quite a bit on the title of this post. It is, after all, not *me* that is hiring you. Nor do I have the power to hire folks at will: it&#8217;s a team decision. But I also don&#8217;t want to claim to speak for anyone else, least of all for Mozilla—my excellent employer and we are, indeed, **[hiring][1]**—since this is really just the things that I know matter to me.

I suspect they matter to a lot of people.

Since I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of interviews lately, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how candidates can help themselves, the things that I need to know, and how someone starts themselves off on the right foot.

  * **Have a resume or CV.** I know it feels archaic and yes, [Github][2] weighs more in my decision-making, but there&#8217;s a reason these documents have existed for so long: I need to know **where you&#8217;ve worked** and **what your job was**. This stuff matters. You don&#8217;t even need the fancy PDF (please, no .doc or .docx, though .rtf is fine) just have a thorough, up-to-date LinkedIn account. And put in details! Brag! What were your roles, your responsibilities? What new processes or tools did you introduce and how did they help? **How did you kick ass?**
  * **Have a Github account**. I will accept [BitBucket][3], but the UI isn&#8217;t as nice. (Also, I use git, we use git. Learning git is a good idea.) Put **your website on Github**. No one is going to steal your personal site and make millions, and it gives me some guaranteed code to browse. But way more importantly&#8230;
  * **Contribute to open source projects!** This isn&#8217;t just &#8220;Mozilla likes Open Source,&#8221; though we do (and I do). This is about **code samples**. Often when we have to ask for code samples, we get contrived projects that don&#8217;t solve any real problems. Contributions to real projects **show me how you write real code** and, at the same time, **how you work with others**. Open source projects are communities, teams. Do you communicate well in pull requests or bugs? Do you revise patches based on feedback? Or, as a maintainer, how do you treat contributions from others?
  * **Have a blog**. The cool thing is that** I don&#8217;t even care if you write about code**. In fact, I&#8217;d love to see that you write about other interests! But because it&#8217;s another website (I am looking for web developers, after all) and it&#8217;s yet another form of communication for me to think about. This is especially if you know you get nervous and don&#8217;t interview well.

And that&#8217;s it! Well, OK, that&#8217;s not really it, not even close. But these are mechanical things, things that are easy to do, for various values of &#8220;easy.&#8221; **I notice the absence** of these things*.*

Obviously there&#8217;s a lot more involved, but this is basic information that helps me, and helps me **before we even talk**. That&#8217;s a great place to start an interview.
