Thank you, [Steve][1].

I didn&#8217;t really realize until today exactly what I owe to Steve Jobs&#8217; vision and dedication. So much of my life and career has been influenced and guided by an interest in screwing about with computers that goes back to the first Mac Plus I had—with its whole 1 megabyte of RAM and 40-megabyte SCSI hard drive—and my dad&#8217;s Macintosh II at work.

It&#8217;s a long, meandering story and probably not terribly interesting, but it really starts in 1993 or so, with Macintosh, and leads inexorably to my entire life now.

Thank you, Steve.
