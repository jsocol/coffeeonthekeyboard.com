A [little while ago][1], I said that I thought we got a B in Q1, but we could move up to an A with a little more work. (This is my favorite grading system: everyone starts at 0 and works up.)

Well, we landed two things:

  * Initial [JavaScript tests][2]. (And for [showfor][3].)
  * Stuck a [crontab][4] in git.

I said these two things would bring us up to an A, so, way to go team!

We entered this quarter with 5 goals around [Continuous Deployment][5]. We&#8217;ve hit three. The other two were stretch goals, and it looks like we&#8217;ll miss them. It&#8217;s been a particularly busy quarter for IT, and there&#8217;s just a bunch of work left to get the JS tests into CI. We&#8217;ll carry those forward into Q2 along with our goals of releasing every week and dropping the &#8216;next&#8217; branch.

I&#8217;m really proud of my team and the work we&#8217;ve done this quarter. We&#8217;ve not only done great work improving the user experience across the site—especially for mobile users—we&#8217;ve also made significant progress toward simplifying and streamlining our releases, which will be crucial to CD.
