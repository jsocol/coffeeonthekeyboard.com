I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about social networking lately, partly because my job deals with it, partly because I&#8217;ve got some Obsessive-Compulsive tendencies. Then [Mostly Lisa][1] [wrote about the &#8220;big three&#8221;][2]—[Twitter][3], [Pownce][4], and [Facebook][5], according to her—and got them back to the front of my mind.<!--more-->

<img src="http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/twitter-screen-shot.png" alt="A sample of my Twitter profile. My user name is 'urbaneexistance'." style="border: 1px dashed #662300; margin: 0pt 6px 0pt 2px; padding: 2px; float: left" />I have a love-hate relationship with social networks. I love some of them (Twitter, [Last.fm][6]) and hate others (Facebook, [MySpace][7]). And because I&#8217;m coldly rational (thank you, Math Degree) I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out what it is that attracts or repulses me from these things.

I joined Facebook fairly early. I went to a big school so we had it within a few months of the public releases. I checked it several times a day. I was the first person I knew to use the &#8220;Photos&#8221; application. I got pissed with the &#8220;Visualize My Network&#8221; option disappeared, and even moreso at the Minifeed, before I found out I *needed* it.

I even weathered the addition of high school students. But then Facebook got hit hard with the Applications/NoNetwork Super Special (wait till the energy bar is full then it&#8217;s punch-punch-down-downforward-forward-punch-back-let-in-everyone). All of a sudden Facebook lost its exclusivity, but more importantly it lost it&#8217;s unifying theme. When it was just college students, or even just high school and college students, you knew you had at least one thing in common with everyone else.

I half-heartedly tried MySpace but it was too noisy. After a few friend requests from people I didn&#8217;t know and real, penis-enlarging spam on the bulletin board, I left.

Somewhere in there I signed up on Last.fm, which I can&#8217;t live without. It&#8217;s completely noiseless—in my experience, anyway—and has helped me find all sorts of new music.

I&#8217;ve quit Facebook twice. Both times for the same reason: no sense of community. (In the brief re-Facebooked period, I just had it aggregate my blog, Twitter, Last.fm, etc.) I quit MySpace because of too much noise and no sense of community. I stay on Last.fm because everyone there listens to enough music to care about it. I stay on Twitter because it&#8217;s mostly Web-2.0-type-savvy people.

What draws me, what keeps me interested, what helps me tolerate noise, is community—or rather some commonality. It gives me a starting point for the &#8220;social&#8221; part of social networking.

The big networks, the Facebooks, the MySpaces, the Bebos, don&#8217;t interest me, because I have nothing in common with them. It&#8217;s like being introduced to someone with no sort of background or any idea what to talk about. It doesn&#8217;t work because *I&#8217;m very awkward*.

What do you think about the various social networks? What makes one appealing and one frustrating?
