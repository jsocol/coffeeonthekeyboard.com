Modular has about 2 dozen artists, ranging from the relatively insufferable Jack Johnson to Gary Jules, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and NYPC. Check out some of their less well-known artists, they&#8217;re pretty good. Gary Jules almost sounds like a latter-day Boss. Think &#8220;Sinaloa Cowboys&#8221; but less depressing.

You might recognize NYPC from a recent, poorly conceived, Intel ad campaign. They do have other songs, though, and they&#8217;re recent EP is pretty good. It&#8217;s one of the better dancepunk albums I&#8217;ve heard, and certainly the best in a few years. (And there are <span style="font-style: italic;">girls</span> in the band. Real ones! Pretty rare in this scene.)

I&#8217;m still trying to find Leave Them All Behind and Rocket Science, so if anyone wants to hook me up with some of their tracks, please do!

<span style="font-style: italic;">Coming up</span>, I talk about last year&#8217;s efforts by BSS, Mogwai, Cursive, and Mastodon.
