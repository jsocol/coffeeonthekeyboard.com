I missed last week. I blame [the holiday][1] on Monday. Also Erik started, which is very exciting!

Tomorrow afternoon is our planned [push for SUMO 2.1][2], which is our new discussion forum component, and migrating the old data into that component. This is huge, since it&#8217;s the first new component serving content creation. (We&#8217;ve been running search results on Kitsune for a while now.)

Everything on our [staging server][3] feels faster on the Kitsune pages than the old pages. I can&#8217;t quite count to 2 loading a Kitsune page. I can usually get to 3 on a Tiki page. That in itself is a huge win, to me. On top of the speed, we&#8217;ve made some big leaps in our infrastructure and have done a lot of work that will directly enable 2.2, our support questions milestone

**Last two weeks**

  * Closed out and reviewed a number of 2.1 bugs. Really, [I lost count][4]. It&#8217;s been fantastic to see the work spread out across the team.
  * Got [2.1][5] ready to go out tomorrow!(!!)
  * Fixed a number of small and last-minute 2.1 bugs.
  * Helped Paul finish out the data migration work so he could focus on his last final and graduate! (Congrats, Paul!)
  * [Built avatars][6] for [users without them][7].
  * Got [email notifications][8] to go out with some help from Jeremy.
  * Welcomed Erik. Helped him get all the development environment stuff worked out.

**This week (me)**

  * Get everyone introduced to Rypple.
  * Navigate a smooth 2.1 launch.
  * Poll the team about a SUMOdev on-site.
  * Finish reviewing Ricky&#8217;s 2.2 UI work.
  * Triage 2.2 and focus the bugs.
  * Help everyone figure out deliverables and timelines for 2.3 mockups as best I can. (Mostly I&#8217;ve done what I can here, I think.)

**This week (team)**

  * Launch 2.1. Smoothly.
  * Go go go on 2.2. On staging the day (evening?) after 2.1 launches.
  * Start spreading around reviews more.
  * Help triage 2.2 and focus it.
