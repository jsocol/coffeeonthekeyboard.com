[We all complained][1], and Microsoft listened to the community: [IE8 will now render in IE8-mode by default][2], and &#8220;developers who want their pages shown using IE8’s “IE7 Standards mode” will need to request that explicitly.&#8221;

Obviously, this is good news for all forward-looking, standards-aware, progressively-enhancing developers out there.

But even more important is the action from Microsoft: the community voiced an opinion and Microsoft listened and responded. To see any major corporation rethink their position because of community pressure is rare enough, but to see a complete reversal is truly an occasion to celebrate.

Hopefully this is indicative of a new attitude at Microsoft, one that supports or even embraces standards and the goals of progressive enhancement.

Now that we&#8217;ve seen what community outrage can do, we should turn our attention to the closed platforms of the iPhone and PSP. It&#8217;s a long shot but we can try!
