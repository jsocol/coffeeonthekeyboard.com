It&#8217;s always been a little strange to me that [Hulu][1] has [profiles][2]. I suppose they&#8217;re for people who interact via the comments on videos, but the profiles seem so bland and token. It&#8217;s as if someone remembered to add them right before they shipped and then they forgot.

Specifically, the part of Hulu profiles I&#8217;m curious about is the &#8220;Favorite TV shows&#8221; and &#8220;Favorite Movies&#8221; boxes.

Hulu: don&#8217;t you *know* what my favorite movies and TV shows are?

Hulu should tell *me* my favorites. Do I ostensibly love [The Simpsons][3] but never watch it? (Yes.) Do I watch re-runs of pseudo-crime dramas like [Lie To Me][4] whenever they&#8217;re available? (Yes.) Have I watched every vampire-related bit of video available? (No. Only [Buffy][5].)

Hulu already does [recommendations][6], but they are surprisingly easy to miss, and seem to be based on watching one particular show or another. They&#8217;re not terrible, but when [Netflix][7] is willing to [spend a million dollars][8] to get some improvement in its recommendation engine, it&#8217;s obvious that people are looking for a little more than Hulu is giving at the moment.

I would like to see Hulu become the [Last.fm][9] of TV and film: teach me about myself, and bring that data and recommendations front and center. Put in a &#8220;Recommended Channel&#8221; and just show me stuff you think I&#8217;ll like, based not on a single movie or show, but the whole package, and what other people with similar taste also like. Show me those other people, too, and let me watch a &#8220;Neighborhood Channel.&#8221;

Go a step further and tell me what other people in my physical area are watching. You ask for my ZIP code: use it for more than marketing stats. If all my neighbors or coworkers are watching a show, maybe it&#8217;s worth checking out.

If there are two things people like, it&#8217;s [being told random facts about themselves][10], and being told what else to like. Hulu should leverage that.
