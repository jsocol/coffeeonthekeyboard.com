Go vote.

If you don&#8217;t know where, lots of websites will help you, even [Google Maps][1].

Don&#8217;t assume that the polls will come true even if you skip voting. Vote.

If you&#8217;re still undecided (have you been living on Mars, in a cave, under a rock, with your eyes closed and your ears covered for the past 2 years) or think the candidates are &#8220;the same,&#8221; I urge you to check out their websites: [BarackObama.com][2] and [JohnMcCain.com][3] and read about their positions.

I assure you, they are very different.

As [David Sedaris][4] said, it&#8217;s like being offered the chicken dinner or a plate of shit with broken glass in it, and asking how the chicken is cooked. No matter which side you&#8217;re on.
