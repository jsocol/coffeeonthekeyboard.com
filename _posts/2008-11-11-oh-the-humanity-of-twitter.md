<a onclick="window.open(this.href, 'newwindow'); return false;" href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> creates a powerful opportunity: no matter who you are, or how big your business, you can put a human &#8220;face&#8221; on Twitter.

Comcast (@[comcastcares][1]), JetBlue (@[jetblue][2]), Biggby Coffee (@[biggbybob][3]) and Starbucks (@[starbucks][4]), even Britney Spears (sorry, I refuse to link that one) have all shown up on Twitter with very real, human exchanges.

I&#8217;m not sure, behind the scenes, whether there are several people or one incredibly busy person at each of these companies, but they&#8217;ve decided to drop the corporate suit and engage their followers. They aren&#8217;t using Twitter as a broadcasting medium, but as a networking and conversation tool.

They *get it*.

Here is one of my favorite examples:

<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/threeofus/status/1000792408">
  <p>
    <a href="http://twitter.com/threeofus/status/1000792408">threeofus:</a> @<a href="http://twitter.com/Starbucks">Starbucks</a> Who actually types the tweets for Starbucks?
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/Starbucks/status/1000851867">
  <p>
    <a href="http://twitter.com/Starbucks/status/1000851867">Starbucks:</a> @<a href="http://twitter.com/threeofus">threeofus</a> Hi, I&#8217;m Brad, I work in the online team. How are you?
  </p>
</blockquote>

So what&#8217;s the trick? What did Starbucks/Brad do right?

  * **Use the First Person.** &#8220;I,&#8221; &#8220;me,&#8221; &#8220;my,&#8221; all make your tweet feel more personal. No real surprise there. &#8220;We,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; work, but not nearly as well. You sound like a spokesperson, instead of a person.
  * **Own the Conversation.** By introducing and naming himself, Brad is taking ownership of the interaction. Even if Starbucks has 10 people reading and responding to tweets, threeofus can feel like she&#8217;s talking to one person.
  * **Engage.** Read and respond to other users, especially @-replies. Read, retweet and share. If you&#8217;re only sending information one way, you aren&#8217;t part of the community. You can also use tools like [Twitter search][5] to find and respond to users talking about you or your company.
  * **Show Emotion. **&#8220;This is so cool,&#8221; &#8220;Wow, long day&#8221; or even just &#8220;:-)&#8221; are all things that a person would say, but a press release never would. You don&#8217;t need to wear your heart on every tweet, but let some of your feelings come outâ€”at least the good ones.
  * **Be Active.** For most of us, Twitter is [ambient information][6]. You need to update regularly to get in to that stream.
  * **Don&#8217;t &#8220;Always Be Closing.&#8221;** Don&#8217;t make every tweet a pitch or a request. That doesn&#8217;t mean you *can&#8217;t* pitch: I link my blog posts on Twitter, my friend @[alecrj][7] mentions his shows. But if every tweet sounds like an advertisement, then you sum up to an infomercial.

Here&#8217;s a comparison: Lansing&#8217;s alternative paper recently started twittering at @[CityPulse][8]. Right now, the biggest words in their tweet cloud are their URL, &#8220;city,&#8221; &#8220;pulse,&#8221; &#8220;check,&#8221; &#8220;out,&#8221; &#8220;pick,&#8221; and &#8220;up.&#8221; Every tweet is trying to drive me to their website or pick up a copy of the paper. They&#8217;ve sent no @ messages, used the word &#8220;I&#8221; once, and have gone a week at a time without updating.

And despite following almost 300 people, they&#8217;ve only got 100 followers.

This is what confuses traditional marketing about Twitter: **the community won&#8217;t listen to you until you listen to the community.**

Of course, there are robots on Twitter, too, and some are very popular, like @[nytimes][9] and @[BarackObama][10]. They are *broadcasters*, not community members. They perform very specific roles and are backed by very unique content. They add enough value that they don&#8217;t need to engage the community.

And yet, if they did, they would be even more powerful.

So do you and your company *get it?*
