It&#8217;s summer, and you know what that means: [big life change blog post][1]!

This one isn&#8217;t quite as big. I love the work I&#8217;m doing at Mozilla and not looking to make a change there. But I am moving across the country. Again.

In July, a week after the Mozilla Summit, I&#8217;ll be picking up and making the move to New York.

<p style="text-align: center;">

I will miss the Mozilla office. As I deliberated and thought about this decision, that was the colossal &#8220;pro&#8221; for staying in the Bay Area. I&#8217;ve made a number of friends here, even though I haven&#8217;t done a good enough job of getting to know people. Feel free to think back on your favorite, relevant Bilbo Baggins quote.

I&#8217;ll also miss the fantastic working environment Mozilla HQ offers. I joked about having 20 people in the same room talking to each other on IRC, but the truth is it&#8217;s a wonderfully collaborative environment, and having people nearby to talk through a problem will be hard to replace.

Seriously, [it&#8217;s awesome][2].

</p>

But the East Coast, and New York in particular, has my family. And my family can take Mozilla HQ in a fight.

It&#8217;s not *just* about family, but family by itself is enough to sway me. It&#8217;s family and a bucket of little-to-medium things. The more I thought about it, the more of those piled up on the New York side—weather and climate, time zone, culture, music, night life, [urban personality][3], getting rid of my car, and so on—all the little things to add up to quality of life.

(&#8220;Weather and climate?&#8221; I hear you inquire. Yes, weather. I&#8217;m a northerner. I grew up with 4 seasons—they weren&#8217;t all 3 months but they were all there—and they mark time for me. And frankly, I miss weather. The Valley has a climate, but it doesn&#8217;t really have &#8220;weather,&#8221; not in the sense I know.)

I don&#8217;t know exactly where I&#8217;ll be yet. Definitely Manhattan or Brooklyn, but I&#8217;m looking at a number of different neighborhoods, from the Upper West Side to Murray Hill to Fort Greene.

Fortunately—obviously, I suppose—I have family I can stay with for a bit while I find a place. If anyone has realtor recommendations, I&#8217;m very interested!

New York is home. It&#8217;s where I was born. It&#8217;s where my father was born. It&#8217;s the best city in the world—Paris is a surprisingly close second—and it&#8217;s where I want to be.

See the form below?

Where&#8217;s home for you?
