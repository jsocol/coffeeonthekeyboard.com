Most of my blog visitors are people trickling in from Google with questions about [rebuilding PHP on RHEL][1], [connecting PHP, IIS6 and SQL Server][2], or, inexplicably, looking for info on the game [Crysis][3].

I should warn, a lot of that stuff is out of date. And I never did end up buying Crysis. (Gaming at 640&#215;480 just isn&#8217;t that fun anymore.)

Anyway, given that traffic profile, I doubt most visitors will care about this. But, in case I&#8217;m wrong, and I often am, I thought you deserved to know about some relatively large changes with me lately.

The first and biggest: I no longer work at Michigan State University. I worked there for a year and a half as an student, and when I graduated, they kept me on as a temporary employee and then offered me a year-long contract position. That contract expired at the end of May—literally: May 31st would&#8217;ve been my last day if it hadn&#8217;t been a Sunday.

My month-to-month lease renewed on June 3rd, so I had a choice of moving everything out very quickly or paying for an extra month. Since I was only bugging out about 100 miles to [my father&#8217;s][4] place, I decided to get out quickly. (Nice for the landlord: there were already people coming to see and apply for the place before I was done packing.)

And then the last week of May I needed to fly out to California.

So in the span of a week, I flew to California and back, ended my job, and moved. Quite a turbulent time. A lot of things, like Twitter and this blog, fell by the wayside. Don&#8217;t worry, though. I have a post about semantic form markup that&#8217;s almost ready to go.

The job thing: I was not particularly excited about staying in the Lansing area when it was offered, but I took it because, basically, everyone told me to. Really, I only ended up staying about 9 months longer than I&#8217;d planned, but I needed to get out of the area. In the future, I may write about my experiences as support staff in a university environment (hint: I didn&#8217;t love it) but for now, know that leaving was a very positive thing for me in a lot of ways.

When you start to feel like [Matthew McConaughey][5] in [Dazed and Confused][6] (&#8220;That&#8217;s what I love about these undergrads, man. I get older; they stay the same age&#8230;&#8221;) it&#8217;s time to move on.

And, while I&#8217;m not yet quite ready to talk about it, it looks like the job situation will work out very well, and very quickly. Of course, I&#8217;ll have to move again.

That&#8217;s the story. Or at least as much as I&#8217;ll tell right now. Now for some technical mumbo-jumbo.

I&#8217;ve been working on a little project—though not in the past three weeks—called [Cocode][7]. It&#8217;s an open-source pastebin app that runs on my [PHP framework, Maveric][8]. Well, not quite a pastebin. More accurately, it&#8217;s a tool to support internal code review. It supports user authentication, comments on code snippets, and, of course, revisions with diffs and syntax highlighting.

Working on Cocode has given me a good reason to do some development on Maveric, itself. I&#8217;ve added some neat ORM features and am working on a real database abstraction layer. I also want to improve routing and several other ugly bits, but, you know, one thing at a time. The changes to Maveric give me a good reason to go back and rework the application layer of [Today&#8217;s Meet][9], as well, though I haven&#8217;t done it yet. What a good time to add some of the features people request!

You can check out [Maveric][8] and [Cocode][7] from Subversion, if you&#8217;re curious. And if you&#8217;re a PHP developer who wants to contribute, please [let me know][10]. I would certainly appreciate the help and a fresh perspective. I&#8217;ll post more about Cocode soon.

Finally, I&#8217;m working on a little WordPress plugin to help with the new rash of irrelevant comment spam I&#8217;m getting. (You know the kind: they just say &#8220;Great Psot!&#8221; and their URL is the important part.) I&#8217;ll post about that one, too.

There&#8217;s my life, lately, both the coding and non-coding aspects. I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this brief, personal interlude. Next up, you&#8217;re regularly scheduled geekery and social media name-calling—except on the West Coast, where you&#8217;re local news is up next.
