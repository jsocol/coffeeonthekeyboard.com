[Amber Simmons][1] wrote a brilliant article on [A List Apart][2] on the [importance of writing][3] to web design.

Amber is absolutely right: writing hasn&#8217;t just taken a back seat to design; design left writing in the bathroom at the gas station.

So much emphasis has been put on user-generated content that we&#8217;ve forgotten that users aren&#8217;t going to generate our headers and footers, or our layout and `alt` tags. All of that "unimportant" stuff has been left to designers: form buttons, FAQs, instructions. Often even important "about" sections are left to designers. No one will read it, anyway.

This attitude is a vicious cycle. No one will read the content, so why bother writing anything worth reading? Why bother reading such bad content?

I will certainly be re-examining my [footer][4] content, with her thoughts in mind.

Just because something is on the web doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t be worth reading.
