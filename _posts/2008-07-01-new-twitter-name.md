To all my Twitter followers, and those not yet [following me][1]:

Twitter lets you change your user name, so I did. Instead of the very long and misspelled &#8220;urbaneexistance,&#8221; I am now @[jamessocol][1].

Shorter, easier to remember, more meaningful.

If you were following me, Twitter says you still should be, no worries. This is one 2.0-mistake I can correct easily.
