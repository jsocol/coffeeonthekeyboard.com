**Last week**

  * Onsite. Valuable, but not in the traditional, bug-fixing sense.
  * Started talking about l10n. Identified some key issues.
  * Got a plan in place for live chat.
  * Got in a half day on Friday before the lack of sleep caught up with me.
  * Got [some][1] [reviews][2] [done][3].

**This week (me)**

  * Break 2.1 into manageable chunks and file bugs.
  * Fix some of those bugs (particularly [bug 561524][4]).
  * Get everyone on the same page for Thursday, our first Kitsune push!
  * Get at least 40% into an engineering plan for the next 3-4 months.
  * Put together some ideas for an intern project.
  * Review lots.

**This week (team)**

  * By Thursday, let&#8217;s be able to handle all regular (ie: non-moderator) actions on the discussion forums on stage.
  * Push 2.0/1.5.4.
