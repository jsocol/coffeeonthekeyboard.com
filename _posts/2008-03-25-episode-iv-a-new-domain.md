I&#8217;ve decided to take the plunge and move the blog to its own domain, whether I was &#8220;ready&#8221; or not.

Hopefully sooner than later, I will create a nice theme and layout for this site. For now, please accept this subtly changed version of Kubrik. I know it&#8217;s not great but I wanted to force myself into making the move.

Now that I have the rather improved features of WordPress at my disposal (I also considered Habari and Movable Type, but ended up sticking with what I knew) I&#8217;ll be able to write about more diverse topics and keep things well-organized. I feel like Blogger was preventing me from really expanding beyond the limited scope I had set for myself by not encouraging organization or really helping people browse by topic.

Please be patient as I reorganize the old posts and get things running over here.
