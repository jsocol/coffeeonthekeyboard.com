So I did end up going to Urban Outfitters. I was about to blow almost $100 on a jacket and hoodie, but then the jacket rang up for 90% off. That&#8217;s right. 90%. I don&#8217;t think she typed in enough 9s, because it was sure supposed to be $50 and came out to $5.

I think people have appreciated the fact that I wore a <gasp /> different shirt.
