Here&#8217;s my new rough sketch of where I&#8217;ll be in Europe:

  * 6-9am, 18 May &#8212; Breakfast at Heathrow
  * 18-22 May &#8212; Ireland (Based in Dublin, Abraham Hostel)
  * 22-24 May &#8212; Paris (Absolute Paris Hostel)
  * 25 May &#8211; 1 June &#8212; Spain/Portugal
  * 2-9 June &#8212; South of France
  * 10-17 June &#8212; Italy
  * 18-21 June &#8211;Berlin (Staying with my German brother)
  * 21-24 June &#8212; Liverpool (Embassie Hostel)
  * 24-28 June &#8212; Ireland (again in Dublin, Abraham Hostel unless it sucks the first time)
  * 9pm 28-8am 29 June &#8212; Heathrow or surround bars.

From the 25th to the 17th isn&#8217;t really specific. I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;ll be and when, but that&#8217;s kind of the circular path I&#8217;m planning. That way I end up in Berlin when I&#8217;m supposed to (getting there either the 17th or 18th).

Giving a lot of time to Ireland, obviously. I want to try to get in a lot of Dublin and also around to other cities like Derry and such. Maybe I&#8217;ll spend 24 hours following Ulysses. Honestly I figured I would start and end in English-speaking countries and if I was scheduling the flights now I&#8217;d probably take a day or two less in Dublin on the way out. Oh well, I&#8217;ll just know that city best.
