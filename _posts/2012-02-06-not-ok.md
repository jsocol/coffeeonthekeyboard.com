I&#8217;m not doing OK right now.

Why is that so hard to admit?

It&#8217;s nothing big, it&#8217;s just a hundred small things and they all happened at the same time and it feels like I can&#8217;t win right now. It feels like if 12 hours could go by without something getting a wrench stuck in it, that would count as a victory right now. It feels like I&#8217;m losing Tetris: there&#8217;s just not enough time to figure out what to do and the wrong piece is on deck.

I had a panic attack this morning. I haven&#8217;t had one of those in years.

But you can&#8217;t just *say*, &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing OK.&#8221; On Twitter it&#8217;s an emotweet. On Facebook it&#8217;s the sort of thing that gets posted to reddit as being ridiculous. It&#8217;s First World Problems. It&#8217;s whining. Everyone else has problems, too. Men don&#8217;t whine about it, they just get it done.

I don&#8217;t need advice, and I don&#8217;t even necessarily need help. I think if I had an emotional reset button I could start over and handle everything.

I really just want a hug and someone to listen and tell me it will be OK.

There aren&#8217;t a lot of places you can say &#8220;I&#8217;m not doing OK.&#8221; But this is my blog, and I can say whatever I damn well please.
