Bought tickets today, got my passport a while ago. I&#8217;m now set to actually get there.

A word about buying tickets. E-tickets are obviously cheaper and if you save the e-mail (in something like GMail) you can print them from anywhere &#8211; no worries about losing them. However, e-tickets are not always possible. Because of the multi-carrier itinerary, or just because one of the 3 airlines didn&#8217;t do e-tickets, I had to do paper tickets. They cost a little more but not a lot, so just suck it up and accept it. I still am getting to Dublin for $604.

And I&#8217;ve got a rough itinerary&#8211;for the parts I&#8217;m willing to plan&#8211;so I thought I would share it:

  * 17 May &#8230; Leave Chicago
  * 18 May &#8230; Arrive Dublin
  * 21 or 23 May &#8230; Ferry from Rosslare to Cherbourg
  * 23 May &#8212; 17 June &#8230; Where the wind takes me
  * 18 June &#8230; Berlin with my German bro
  * 21 June &#8230; Fly to Liverpool (RyanAir or EasyJet)
  * 25 June &#8230; Ferry to Dublin
  * 28 June &#8230; Fly home
