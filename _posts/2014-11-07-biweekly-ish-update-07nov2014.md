[My finger][1] is mostly healed. I have a whole new terror of flaying.



And [Teacher Tools][2] launched! I&#8217;ve been focused on getting the word out and answering questions from customers this week.

I&#8217;ve also tried to come up for air, both taking a little downtime and catching up on pull reqs.

Thanks to the incredible, and patient, work of [Florent Messa][3], we got [Waffle][4] master working on Django 1.7. Florent and I spent a lot of Wednesday working more or less synchronously to crack apart a big pull req into small parts and figure out the source of some frustrating test failures. It was one of those &#8220;wow the internet can be pretty amazing&#8221; moments for me.



I also stuck my nose into a couple of places I maybe shouldn&#8217;t have. [Mozilla made me uncomfortable][5] and I got myself involved in the [tip4commit][6] kerfuffle, which lead to contacting Bountysource as well and now Bountysource is [thinking about the whole thing][7].

So am I. Because of tip4commit I started thinking about the role of money and bounties in modern open source and I have a couple of big issues that I don&#8217;t think anyone has solved yet. That&#8217;s for another blog post, though.

I&#8217;m going to keep hanging a little back from intense product work on TodaysMeet, spending my time there more on users, outreach, research, business, stuff like that—and some low-hanging fruit or post-launch tasks—while I figure out the next big thing to tackle.

I also want to finish up some writing and I&#8217;ll be doing some freelance and open source work over the next few weeks.
