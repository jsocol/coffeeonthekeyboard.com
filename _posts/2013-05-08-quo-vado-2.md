*&#8220;Where am I going?&#8221;*

I didn&#8217;t intend to be annoyingly coy or secretive. There is no bag, and certainly no cat to let out of it. I&#8217;m not going to some super secret stealth startup.

I&#8217;m taking some time to spend on some of my own projects. [TodaysMeet][1] and [BundleScout][2] are the big ones.

There are also some ideas I&#8217;ve been kicking around for a few years I&#8217;d like build. Or at least kick them around a little more actively. They should be good learning exercises and provide fodder for more blog posts.

And maybe I&#8217;ll finally finish the theme for this blog.
